  <p style="color:#ffffff;text-align:left;"><i>"And S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded after the SSR was able to defeat the nearly indomitable force known as HYDRA."</i>
</br>―<span style="color: #0066ff;">Leo Fitz</span>
 
    <p style="color:#ffffff;text-align:left;">S.H.I.E.L.D. was formed shortly after <span style="color: #0066ff;"> World War II</span> as a successor to the <span style="color: #0066ff;">Strategic Scientific Reserve</span> (SSR), an Allied deep science agency which fought against the Nazi-sponsored special weapons division<span style="color: #0066ff;"> HYDRA </span>during the war.</p>
	
	  
	 <p style="color:#ffffff;text-align:left;">The founders of the new agency were<span style="color: #0066ff;"> Chester Phillips</span>, the director of the SSR, <span style="color: #0066ff;">Howard Stark</span>, an industrialist of great wealth and a scientific genius, and <span style="color: #0066ff;">Margaret "Peggy" Carter</span>, the former partner of the American war hero <span style="color: #0066ff;">Steve Rogers</span>, better known as Captain America.</p>
	  

<p style="color:#ffffff;text-align:left;">The <b>Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division</b>, better known by its acronym <b>S.H.I.E.L.D.</b>, is a <span style="color: #0066ff;">United States</span> extra-governmental military counter-terrorism and intelligence agency, tasked with maintaining global security. Founded in the wake of the Allied victory over the Axis powers and <span style="color: #0066ff;"> HYDRA</span> in <span style="color: #0066ff;">World War II</span>, S.H.I.E.L.D. was organized to protect the United States, and later the entire world, from all possible threats. With its advanced weapons and extraordinary agents, S.H.I.E.L.D. was maybe the greatest military power on<span style="color: #0066ff;"> Earth</span>. Run by <span style="color: #0066ff;">Nick Fury</span> and the <span style="color: #0066ff;">World Security Council</span> in the modern age, S.H.I.E.L.D. had to deal with the significant rise in enhanced individuals, dangerous advanced technology, and alien contact. But all the problems S.H.I.E.L.D. had to solve eventually led to the formation of the <span style="color: #0066ff;">Avengers</span>, a response team that was recruited to save the world during the <span style="color: #0066ff;">alien invasion</span> of <span style="color: #0066ff;"> Earth </span>in 2012. The agency became publicly known after the <span style="color: #0066ff;">Battle of New York</span>, partially because of the <span style="color: #0066ff;">Rising Tide</span> website.</p>
<h2><font color="grey">HYDRA's Rebirth</h2>
<p style="color:#ffffff;text-align:left;"><i>"After the war, S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded, and I was recruited. The new HYDRA grew, a beautiful parasite, inside S.H.I.E.L.D."</i>
</br>―<span style="color: #0066ff;">Arnim Zola</span> to <span style="color: #0066ff;">Captain America</span> and <span style="color: #0066ff;">Black Widow</span></p>

<p style="color:#ffffff;text-align:left;">Shortly after the war, as part of <span style="color: #0066ff;">Operation Paperclip</span>, S.H.I.E.L.D. recruited the scientists of <span style="color: #0066ff;">Nazi Germany</span> as a think tank for the newborn agency. The infamous <span style="color: #0066ff;">Arnim Zola</span> was among the recruited scientists, but he used his new position to secretly rebuild HYDRA. With no one suspecting, HYDRA secretly grew within S.H.I.E.L.D., orchestrating many crises in the world over the next decades.</p>
<h2><font color="grey">Project Reclamation</h2>

<p style="color:#ffffff;text-align:left;"><i>"As you know, certain world events, should they occur, trigger what we in S.H.I.E.L.D. call Project Reclamation. This protocol was designed as a black-ops action known only to the highest-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives. Once initiated, Project Reclamation is conducted through secure communication known as electronic mail. Our agents were instructed to gather you, the selected elite, from a host of nations, and bring you here to give..."</i>
</br>―<span style="color: #0066ff;">Rick Stoner</span>

<p style="color:#ffffff;text-align:left;">Under the supervision of General<span style="color: #0066ff;"> Rick Stoner</span>, S.H.I.E.L.D. started<span style="color: #0066ff;"> Project Reclamation</span>, a protocol known only to the highest-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives and designed as a precaution in case of a catastrophic event that would destroy the world as the mankind knew it. A gigantic installation called the <span style="color: #0066ff;">Lighthouse</span> was built below ground on the shores of Lake Ontario to serve as a survival bunker for the selected elite from a host of nations. However, the 1972 Hydrogen Wave Crisis was averted and the protocol was never initiated. The Lighthouse and its original purpose eventually fell into obscurity.</p>
<h2><font color="grey">Running Ava Starr</h2>
<p style="color:#ffffff;text-align:left;">S.H.I.E.L.D. sent their consultant,<span style="color: #0066ff;"> Bill Foster</span>, to check<span style="color: #0066ff;"> Ava Starr</span>, who had been exposed to Quantum Energy and now could phase through matters. With the promise to eventually cure her, S.H.I.E.L.D. recruited Starr as an assassin and over the years she did many missions for them. However, they never found a cure and Starr left the organization one her condition worsened.</p>
