    <p style="color:#ffffff;text-align:left;"><i>"The principle S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded upon was pure Protection. One word. Sometimes to protect one man against himself, other times to protect the planet against an alien invasion from another universe but the belief that drives us all is the same, whether it’s one man, or all mankind."
</br>"That they’re worth saving."</i>
</br>―<span style="color: #0066ff;"> Nick Fury</span> and <span style="color: #0066ff;">Phil Coulson<span></p>

<p style="color:#ffffff;text-align:left;">The <b>Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division</b>, better known by its acronym <b>S.H.I.E.L.D.</b>, is a <span style="color: #0066ff;">United States</span> extra-governmental military counter-terrorism and intelligence agency, tasked with maintaining global security. Founded in the wake of the Allied victory over the Axis powers and <span style="color: #0066ff;"> HYDRA</span> in <span style="color: #0066ff;">World War II</span>, S.H.I.E.L.D. was organized to protect the United States, and later the entire world, from all possible threats. With its advanced weapons and extraordinary agents, S.H.I.E.L.D. was maybe the greatest military power on<span style="color: #0066ff;"> Earth</span>. Run by <span style="color: #0066ff;">Nick Fury</span> and the <span style="color: #0066ff;">World Security Council</span> in the modern age, S.H.I.E.L.D. had to deal with the significant rise in enhanced individuals, dangerous advanced technology, and alien contact. But all the problems S.H.I.E.L.D. had to solve eventually led to the formation of the <span style="color: #0066ff;">Avengers</span>, a response team that was recruited to save the world during the <span style="color: #0066ff;">alien invasion</span> of <span style="color: #0066ff;"> Earth </span>in 2012. The agency became publicly known after the <span style="color: #0066ff;">Battle of New York</span>, partially because of the <span style="color: #0066ff;">Rising Tide</span> website.</p>

<p style="color:#ffffff;text-align:left;">In 2014, through the actions of<span style="color: #0066ff;"> Captain America</span>, the world became aware of the fact that S.H.I.E.L.D. was <span style="color: #0066ff;">infiltrated</span> and largely controlled by the terrorist organization <span style="color: #0066ff;">HYDRA</span>. After the <span style="color: #0066ff;">battle</span> in which S.H.I.E.L.D.'s primary headquarters, the<span style="color: #0066ff;"> Triskelion</span>, was heavily damaged, all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s classified files were dumped on the Internet, and the agency was disavowed by its commanding governments and labeled a terrorist organization. Many S.H.I.E.L.D. officials were taken into custody and subjected to rigorous questioning. However, despite the <span style="color: #0066ff;">massive manhunt</span> on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s agents, a few operatives scattered across the world in most secret bases remained loyal to their oath, saving the most necessary paraphernalia for future use. But the team most responsible for the survival of S.H.I.E.L.D. was the <span style="color: #0066ff;">team</span> of Agent <span style="color: #0066ff;">Phil Coulson</span>, who valiantly led his teammates against the forces of HYDRA led by the traitors<span style="color: #0066ff;"> John Garrett</span> and <span style="color: #0066ff;">Grant Ward</span>, winning the <span style="color: #0066ff;">battle </span>in which Garrett's plan ultimately failed. After that battle, Nick Fury appointed <span style="color: #0066ff;">Phil Coulson</span> the new director of S.H.I.E.L.D. and tasked him with rebuilding the agency from scratch.</p>

<p style="color:#ffffff;text-align:left;">Now working from the shadows and hunted by almost every army in the world, Coulson used his old team as the core of S.H.I.E.L.D. and recruited mercenaries, former agents, and others to help fill the organization's ranks, while simultaneously continuing the fight against HYDRA. At the same time, another faction of S.H.I.E.L.D. arose, this one led by <span style="color: #0066ff;">Robert Gonzales</span>, who refused to accept Coulson's authority, believing his faction to be the only "real S.H.I.E.L.D.". After the<span style="color: #0066ff;"> Battle for the Kree City</span>, Gonzales' faction revealed its existence,<span style="color: #0066ff;"> attacking and capturing</span> Coulson's base, the <span style="color: #0066ff;">Playground</span>. This ignited an open conflict between the two S.H.I.E.L.D. factions. However, after successfully working together to<span style="color: #0066ff;"> attack </span>and destroy the <span style="color: #0066ff;">Arctic HYDRA Research Facility</span>, Coulson successfully proposed a merger of the two factions which occurred in mid-2015. But the peace did not last long, as the <span style="color: #0066ff;">Inhumans</span>, a super-powered humanoid race led by<span style="color: #0066ff;"> Jiaying</span>, declared<span style="color: #0066ff;"> war</span> on S.H.I.E.L.D. The fight was short and S.H.I.E.L.D. was able to prevent any further damage. After the war, Coulson started a<span style="color: #0066ff;"> new program</span> of recruiting and training Inhumans for a <span style="color: #0066ff;">team</span> to deal with various threats.</p>
